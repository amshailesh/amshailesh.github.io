       Casting resins are specially developed epoxy resins, which are designed for casting moulds, figures, jewellery and some other applications. We show you where a casting resin should be used and what to consider when buying a casting resin.</b>
        </p>
        
        <p><b>Casting resin is a low-viscosity epoxy resin, which consists of two components:</b> the actual resin and the matching hardener. When these two components are mixed, a chemical reaction occurs, which causes the mass to harden for some time. And this brings us to the special features of casting resin – its thin consistency. This property allows the resin to penetrate and fill even the smallest gaps and cavities. The thinner consistency also has an influence on the curing time, which is considerably longer. With the casting resin, we therefore have a highly specialised product for very specific applications.</p>
        
        <p>
        Casting Resin Properties :
            
            <ul>
        <li><b>Low viscosity consistency</b></li>
        <li><b>Significantly longer curing times</b></li>
        <li><b>Therefore longer processing times</b></li>
        <li><b>With casting resin thicker layers can be cast</b></li>
        <li><b>Due to the thin consistency, layers of paint mix quickly</b></li>
        <li>High quality Epoxy resin with hard surface once hardened</li>
        <li>UV, stain and scratch resistant</li>
        <li>It dries out ultra clear and is very durable. It dries in 36 hours</li>

          <p><b>Colouring Casting Resin</b><br><br>
        Casting resin can be coloured like epoxy resin with colour pastes, alcohol inks and colour pigments.           
                  
                  </p>
                  <p><b>ResinTint Liquid Pigment Set</b></p>

                  <img src="assets/img/caste2.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-5" />
                  
                  <p>Since casting resin is low viscous, i.e. thin-bodied, different layers of paint mix faster than with epoxy resin. This does not play a role in most applications, but for example in resin art a good colour separation is important.</p>
                  
                  <img src="assets/img/caste3.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-5" />
                  
                  <p><b>Casting Resin Molds</b><br><br>
                  <b>The fastest way to start with Resin casting is using silicone molds.</b> They are available in different shapes and sizes – from small resin casting molds for producing resin jewelry to big molds for casting spheres and other geometric shapes.
                  
                  </p>
                  
                  <p><b>Silicone Resin Casting Molds</b></p>
                  <img src="assets/img/caste4.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-5" />
                  <p><b>Resin Casting Molds and Tools Set</b></p>

                  <p>Maximum possible Layer Thickness</p>
                  <img src="assets/img/caste6.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-5" />
                  
                  <p class="text-justify"><b>Casting resins usually cure much more slowly, so they produce less heat.</b> This allows significantly thicker casting layers of up to 10 centimeters. The maximum amount that can be processed at once is also increased, so that depending on the product, up to 10 kg can be processed at once. However, please note the manufacturer’s instructions, as there are also products with which a maximum of 5 centimetres thick layer can be cast at once.</p>
                  
                  <p class="text-justify">The heat development is generally a very important issue, because <b>if the layer is too thick or too large, epoxy resin in particular can become so hot that it can cause burns.</b> The quality of the cured mixture also suffers, so that total damage to the project can be the result. If the casting resin also becomes too hot due to the exothermic reaction, toxic fumes are released. <b>Therefore, always wear protective clothing and a breathing mask.</b></p>
                  
                  <p><b>Curing Times</b><br><br>
                  <b>Casting resins need up to one week to cure completely.</b> The huge advantage lies in the processing time: If epoxy resin can only be processed for a few minutes up to one hour, Resin Casting Resin offers products with a processing time of up to 24 hours. This has several positive effects:
                      
                      <ul>
                  <li>For larger areas, this leaves more time for casting and embedding.</li>
                          <li>Especially with large quantities of resin with different colours a lot of time is needed.</li>
                          <li>Air bubbles can escape much longer due to the open time. </li>
                  </ul>

                  <br><br>
                  
                  In order not to suffer any setbacks, you should always consider using the right product before pouring resin. Cast resin can be used for the following applications:

                  <li>If you want to cast objects or pour wood, seal the surface with a little epoxy resin first</li>
                  <li><b>Read the cast resin manufacturer’s instructions regarding mixing ratio</b> and other safety-relevant information</li>

                  <li>Mix both components carefully and for a few minutes</li>
                  <li>If you want to colour the epoxy casting resin, add the colour paste or colour pigments and mix the whole thing again thoroughly</li>
                  <li>Let the whole thing stand for one minute <b>so that some of the air mixed in can escape</b></li>
                  <li><b>Pour the resin mixture into the mold</b> or the cavity to be filled</li>
                  <li>Any <b>air bubbles can be removed with a hot air dryer or a Butane Torch</b></li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
              <li><b>If you want to cast objects, first pour a small amount of resin</b></li>
                  <li>Then place the objects to be poured in with a toothpick or wooden spatula</li>
                  <li>With heavy materials, the first layer should already be dry so that they do not sink to the bottom</li>

                  <p>Clear Casting Resin – How to Achieve transparent Results<br>
                  If you do not want to colour your casting resin, then for most applications it is desired that the casting resin hardens crystal clear.
                  </p>
                  
                  <img src="assets/img/caste9.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-5" />
                  <p class="text-justify">Hardness of the Surface<br><br>
                  <b>In general it can be said that epoxy resin surfaces are harder than those of cast resins.</b> This need not always be a bad thing, because lower hardness means more flexibility, which can be a great advantage especially when working with wood, glass or other changing materials. For example, wood shrinks due to changing temperatures or humidity. It is important to consider whether these properties are desired or not. <b>For a table or a surface with a high mechanical load, an epoxy resin, which forms a hard and abrasion-resistant layer, is the better choice.</b> It is therefore worth applying a layer of epoxy resin as a finish to achieve better mechanical strength, for example on a wooden table.
                      
                      <br><br>
                      Susceptibility to the Inclusion of Air Bubbles<br><br>
                      <b>Both epoxy resin and cast resin Both materials are equally susceptible to air bubble entrapment.</b> Air bubbles can escape more easily with epoxy resin because it is a thinner layer. This allows the bubbles to rise to the surface faster and thus burst. However, cast resin also has an advantage with regard to air inclusions: <b>Due to the long pot life, the air bubbles have longer time to escape from the cast resin.</b><br><br>
                      
                      But also when working with casting resin, you can make some preparations to avoid air bubbles as far as possible, even with thicker layers. If you are working with porous surfaces such as wood, you can apply a thin layer of epoxy resin in advance. This will seal the surface and prevent air bubbles from escaping from these porous surfaces and getting into the resin. The same applies to objects that you want to embed in the resin – a sealant always helps to reduce air inclusions in case of doubt.
