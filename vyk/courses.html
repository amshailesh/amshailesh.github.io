"could not hold them.But because our Trust is a service oriented organization,we found"
it very difficult to arrange for a new and bigger room.We are very gratefulto the school's authority Mr.Ranganath for bearing with us in that

<br />
<span style="display: block; color: white;"><span style="display: block; font-size: large;">&nbsp;Cosmic Healing is a method of healing through light energy. Usually while extracting iron from its ore or in find out the components in Iron, a beam of light is passed through it. This will give the details of various components. Light is a form of energy. As we know matters &nbsp;react with energy, they also react with light energy. For example diamond, mercury etc. react with light by reflecting it. Even glass has reflects light. The body of human beings animals and plants absorb light. light rays have an altered frequency or wavelength<br />
which a body needs in particular. The healer holds palmsin perticula position and scan near the affected part ofthe client so that the body feel the energy of that particular frequency or wavelength which is required / or not<br />
required by it.&nbsp;</span></span><br />

<div class="body" style="text-align: center;">
<div class="body">
<p style="cursor: text; line-height: 26px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">Reiki is the method discovered by the Buddhists which was long lost&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">among the Indians. Its a technique of tapping the Universal Energy&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">through yanthras and manthras. Yanthras are nothing but the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">various symbols whereas manthras are the prayers. These prayers remind&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">us the kindness of God and the way in which&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">we are ought to live in this world. They just render a person more&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">humble.Reiki is almost similar to Cosmic Healing where&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;">Rei</span>&nbsp;means&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;">Universal</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;">Ki</span>&nbsp;means&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;">Energy,</span>&nbsp;together called Universal Energy.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: white; font-size: large;">Reiki is a method of touch healing which needs some attunements. Once a person receives an initiation he becomes&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">a Reiki channel. There are some Ki exercises which are to be practised daily so that the initiated energy doesn&#39;t&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">die out. It has a prayer that reminds us of Universal brotherhood and has to be chanted everyday. Once the healer&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">touches some ailing part with a concentrated mind the Reiki starts flowing from him to the client.</span></p>

<p style="cursor: text; line-height: 26px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">As we move further to second level of Reiki some symbols are used to&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">heal a person. The healer is attuned to use the symbols. Attunement is&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">an initiation wherein the channel to the universl force is&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">tuned, so that the Ki flows through the healer. The symbols are like</span><br />
<span style="color: white; font-size: large;">keys to the vast and infinite Universal Energy&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">which is present in the Universe. Once the symbols and their application&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">&nbsp;is known any form of energy to heal any particular&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white;"><span style="font-size: large;">disease can be accessed.&nbsp; Its like having a key to different rooms in a house</span>.</span></p>

<p style="cursor: text; line-height: 26px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: white; font-size: large;"><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 102); font-family: &quot;arial black&quot;, &quot;avant garde&quot;;">This the special course taught only in our kendra</span>.&nbsp;Dharbha HEaling is a method wherein a particular kind of grass grown in the nature</span><br />
<span style="color: white; font-size: large;">is used in healing.Its especially used by people of Hindu cult in rituals. Dharbha is Naturally born and has special&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">effect of matter. Dharbha has magnetic empowerment and has nullifying effect. For cleaning purpose and in &lsquo;Homa&rsquo; which&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">is a Hindu ritual Dharbha is used. After the &lsquo;Homa&rsquo; the ash of the burnt Dharbha is used as &lsquo;<span style="font-weight: 700;">Raksha</span>&rsquo;.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">Dharbha has 3 points. Namely:</span></p>

<ul style="padding-left: 25px; text-align: left;">
</ul>

<ul style="padding-left: 25px; text-align: left;">
  <li><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">1.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;">Moola Bhaga&nbsp;</span>- which means the Root.</span></li>
  <li><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">2.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;">Madhya Bhaga&nbsp;- which means Middle.</span></span></li>
  <li><span style="color: white; font-size: large;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">3.&nbsp;Agra Bhaga&nbsp;- which means the Tip.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p style="cursor: text; line-height: 26px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">Generally, while healing Dharbha is used for having nullifying&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">effect. Even in the rituals it is used for the same reason. Once the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">negatives are nullified Dharbha performs a magnetic empowerization.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="body" style="cursor: text; line-height: 26px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">Mudra Healing is a method of Self Healing through various mudras i.e.</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">&nbsp;handfolds or handlocks. The world in which we live has lots of&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">. Earth is made up of 5 building blocks or matter or Dhathus.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">They are Fire, Wind, Earth(crust), Water and Void. These are known as&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;">Pancha Dhathus</span>.</span><br />
<span style="color: white; font-size: large;">Even human being is made up of these Dhathus. An imbalance in these&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">elements cause physical or mental disturbance. The Human Body&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">continuously emanates Electro Magnetic Waves (Aura) and this emission is&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">&nbsp;concentrated in the hands. This is the primary reason as to why the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">hand has the power of healing diseases only by a touch. The Positive&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">thought waves, Eyes, Accupressure, Spiritual Healing or Angelic Healing&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">are all capable of curing a disease. Diseases are born When the 5&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">elements are unstable or imbalanced. Our sages &amp; hermits perceived&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">that the 5 fingers in our hand represent the 5 distinct elements in&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">nature. So, they introduced Mudra Healing. Here the different fingers&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">are folded to get different shapes and are pressed and held in an order.</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">&nbsp;This cures some of our Physical and Mental disorders.</span></p>

&nbsp;</span></h2>

<p style="cursor: text; line-height: 26px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">EFT is a technique where a person is freed from his overwhelming&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">emotions. The Psychologists have done researches and have uncovered many&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">&nbsp;valuable aspects to our thinking process &amp; our behaviours. But the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">vast majority of them do very little to give people rapid, long lasting&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">relief from their emotional concerns. EFT is a new tool with scientific&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">component. Our bodies have a profound electric nature. Sometimes static</span><br />
<span style="color: white; font-size: large;">electricity is discharged from our fingertips. A distressing memory&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">causes a disruption in the body&#39;s&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">energy system which results in Negative Emotions. EFT can nullify these&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">-ve emotions. Repeating some mental phrases or positive affirmations&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">that is relevant to the kind of emotions will fix the problem. Continue&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">the process until the problem is gone. If this process is performed with&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">&nbsp;persistence it will unload the fears, anger, grief, frustration,</span><br />
<span style="color: white; font-size: large;">depression and other negative emotions.</span></p>

<br />
<span style="display: block; color: white; font-size: large;">&nbsp; Gayathri Avartha Dhyana is a kind of meditation where you just dont</span><span style="display: block; color: white; font-size: large;">sit and meditate. Here meditation is done along with</span><span style="display: block; color: white; font-size: large;">Asanas And chanting of Gayathri Manthra. Each syllable in the Gayathri</span><span style="display: block; color: white; font-size: large;">Manthra is assigned an asana or posture. The person has to meditate on</span><span style="display: block; color: white; font-size: large;">these syllables simultaneously doing the respective Asanas with which</span><span style="display: block; color: white; font-size: large;">the syllable is related with. This is very helpful in bringing about a</span><span style="display: block; color: white; font-size: large;">co-ordination between Body and Mind.</span></h2>

<p style="cursor: text; line-height: 26px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">The Mantra is:</span><br />
<span style="color: white; font-size: large;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">OM THATH SAVITHURVARENIYAM BHARGO DEVASYA DHEEMAHI DHIYOYONAH PRACHODAYATH</span><br />
<br />
We know energy is released when a work is done. The released energy&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">will be in the form of Sound, Heat and Light. According to research the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">whole Universe is revolving round a common cente. When this rotation&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">takes place there should be a release of enormous energy. A fan&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">revolving at a speed of 500 to 1000rpm (Rotations Per Minute) generates a</span><br />
<span style="color: white; font-size: large;">kind of humming sound. Imagine the sound generated by the spinning and&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">revolving of the whole Universe at thousands of rpms. But according to&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">science the sound does not travel in vaccum. But you cannot deny the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">fact that sound is generated at such a speed. This sound is a subtler&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">sound and was heard by our sages and they called the sound Pranava (Life</span><br />
<span style="color: white; font-size: large;">giving) and the sound generated is OM a humming sound as similar to the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">&nbsp;rotation of fan. Om has 3 syllables Aa,oo and Mm. Aa is the beginning&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">of the sound Vibration, Oo is the sustainence of the wave and Mm is the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">terminal point of the vibration. Sound is an electromagnetic wave and&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">can travel like all other waves. Hence, it can travel even through</span><br />
<span style="color: white; font-size: large;">Vaccum. But this is not yet proved whereas the opposite is certainly&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">proved. When we accept that sound is an EM wave it should be accepted&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">that it can travel through space like all other EM Waves but in a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">subtler form. As the Space has a lot of fiction like planets and stars&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">this will cause the subtler sound wave to die. Without the Blocks the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">wave would have never died. So the resultant subtler sound is AUM(OM).&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">In GAD this Primary or the first possible sound inthe Universe is&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">uttered and then the gayathri Mantra is chanted. The meaning of this&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">verse is:</span><br />
<span style="color: white; font-size: large;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">&quot;Let the light of thousands of Stars in the Universe reside in me. And let it guide my mind in a good and virtuous path.&quot;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="cursor: text; line-height: 26px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">The art of healing with finger pressure over points on the ear is known as Auricular Therapy. Finger pressure is the safest way for simulation and most economical also. Pressure can be applied till the person feels the numbness, soreness, coolness or heat. These sensations should be felt from the point on ears to the affected part of the body. Finger nails, finger tips &amp; finger flats are the three ways of applying the pressure. Apply pressure for one minute to five minute at each point in each session. Apply these stimulations once or twice or whenever the symptoms are felt. The apllication of pressure stimulates blood flow to the that part of the body to which the point is connected with. People with knowledge of anatomy will know it clearly. Imagine a fully grown-up foetus in the mother&rsquo;s womb. The foetus looks exactly like our ear. The whole body is represented by the ear in much same way as foetus. Exact locations differ from person to person and may change under varying conditions and&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">&nbsp;configurations. When a person is ill the color of ear&#39;s skin at the point related to that part of the body might be different. Or there may be a slight swelling, peeling, a small sore and might become very sensitive to the pressure w.r.t. the adjacent areas. The sensitivity can&nbsp; be detected by gently touching the ear surface with constant persistent&nbsp; pressure.</span></p>

<p style="cursor: text; line-height: 26px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">Pendulum Dousing is not a method of healing. It is technique of sensing whether a particular chakra or energy center is blocked, close, open, rotating clockwise or anti-clockwise etc. Pendulum increases a healers sensitivities to the energy flow because it acts as an amplifier. The pendulums which are pear shaped are best used for this purpose. If the Pendulum moves in a clockwise direction it denotes a psychodynamically open chakra i.e. the psychological experiences governed by that chakra are full &amp; well balanced. If the Pendulum moves in counter clockwise direction it denotes a psychodynamically closed chakra which means that particular area is a problem area in psychological aspect. The energy flowing through are imbalanced. The size of the circle made by the pendulum is related to the chakras stregth and the amount of enegy flowing through it. If a larger circle is circumscribed by the pendulum there is a lot of energy flowing through. If the circle is small there is comparitively less</span><br />
<span style="color: white; font-size: large;">energy flowing through it. Meaning of each different kind of circles formed by the pendulum are explained &amp; also the judging of conditions from the circles is taught.</span></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Crystal Healing is a method of healing through light energy. Usually&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">while extracting iron from its ore or in find out the components in&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">Iron, a beam of light is passed through it. This will give the details&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">of various components. Light is a form of energy. As we know matters&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">react with energy, they also react with light energy. For example&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">diamond, mercury etc. react with light by reflecting it. Even glass has&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">reflects light. The body of human beings animals and plants absorb&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">light. Crystals are some costly stones which are also capable of&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">absorbing &amp; reflecting light. Their refractive Index is such that&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">they by holding them at different position light can be directed back or&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">&nbsp;can be allowed to flow through. As crystals are transparent light will&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">also peneterate them.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">These light rays have an altered frequency or wavelength which a body&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">needs in particular. The healer holds the crystal near the affected part&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">&nbsp;of the client so that the body absorbs light energy of that particular&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">frequency or wavelength which is required by it. Its almost similar to&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">Cosmic Healing but the only thing is that the natural energy absorber&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">like Crystals are used.</span></p>

<p style="cursor: text; line-height: 26px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">Mind Sound Resonance is a technique of attaining bliss by mentally&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">generating a sound that resonates. According to scientists mind is mere&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">functioning of the brain. EEG records these changes in the brain. Brain&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">Atlas can scan different sections of brain at any point of time.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">Position Emission Topography(PET) can record even the minute changes in&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">blood flow in the the capillaries of the brain. These have all indicated&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">&nbsp;that we use very less (hardly 2%) of the brains capacity. According to&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">Yoga Sutra mind is:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: white; font-size: large;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">&quot;Pramana viparyaya vikalpa nidhra smrthayah&quot;<br />
Perception, Mirage, Perverted Verbal Ideas, Deep Sleep &amp; store<br />
house of Memories.</span></span></p>

<p style="cursor: text; line-height: 26px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">Mind can be turbulent at times &amp; calm at some other instance. These cause the Mind aves to go down &amp; up.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">Sound is a form of energy according to science. It moves as waves</span><br />
<span style="color: white; font-size: large;">through compressions and rarefactions. Sound needs air to propogate. The&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">&nbsp;compressions and rarefactions vibrate the er &amp; we hear the sound.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">Sound According to Yoga is Vibration. It is a wave which can be audible&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">or inaudible and can be generated even mentally. Shabdha is a quality of&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">&nbsp;the Space(Akasha). Yoga says that sound can travel even through Vaccum.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">&nbsp;This separates it from the concept of sound in physics. The subtler&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">sounds are heard by yogis alone. The Spectrum of Shabda, Sound as&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">postulated in Yoga &amp; Spiritual Lore is much broader &amp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">comprehensive than the sound conceived by science.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: white; font-size: large;">Resonance is a phenomena that occurs when the frequency of a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">particular object matches with the frequency of a generated sound wave.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">Because of the matching at every point of the 2 waves a new wave is&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">generated. The resultant wave has a doubled amplitude. In otherwords the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">&nbsp;reinforcement or prolongation of sound by reflection or synchronous</span><br />
<span style="color: white; font-size: large;">vibration is called Resonance. When 2 waves are 180 degrees out of phase&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">&nbsp;there is no match. But in resonance there is fine tuning. When matching&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">&nbsp;occurs in musical Instruments, there is resonance, &amp; hence melody.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">Bhramari (repitition of sound &#39;M&#39; like humming of bee) generates&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">resonance capable of bringing a fine massaging effect throughout the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">body.</span></p>

<p style="cursor: text; line-height: 26px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">MSRT or Mind Sound Resonance Technique is to generate resonance&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">throughout the body by repeating a mental sound. Thus, we will be able&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">to gain mastery over the mind &amp; reach subtle layers of mind or&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">superconsciousness. Thereby enhancing the power of mind &amp; attaining&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">the bliss of silence.<br />

Scientific Insight into Accupressure</span></p>

<div class="body">
<p style="cursor: text; line-height: 26px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: white;">The art of healing with finger pressure over various points on the body is known as Accupressure. Finger pressure is the safest way for simulation and most economical also. Pressure can be applied till the person feels the numbness, soreness, coolness or heat. These sensations should be felt from the point on the body to the affected part of the body. Finger nails, finger tips &amp; finger flats are the three ways of&nbsp; applying the pressure. Apply pressure for one minute to five minute at each point in each session. Apply these stimulations once or twice or whenever the symptoms are felt. The apllication of pressure stimulates</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">blood flow to the that part of the body to which the point is connected with. People with knowledge of anatomy will know it clearly.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: white;">Accupressre is almost similar to accupuncture. The only difference is in accupressure a constant pressure is applied for some</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">period on the point which is related anatomically to the ailing part of the body. Whereas in Accupuncture very thin pins are pricked into those points. For accupuncture the perfect Knowledge of Human Anatomy is very essential because if the pin is inserted at a wrong point it may have an&nbsp; adverse effect. Doctors are best suited to do accupuncture. Laymen can be content with Accupressure. When a person is ill the color of the skin at the point of the body, related to the ailing organ might be different. Or there may be a slight&nbsp; swelling, peeling, a small sore and might become very sensitive to the pressure w.r.t. the adjacent areas. The sensitivity can be detected by gently touching the skin surface with constant persistent pressure.<br />

<p style="cursor: text; line-height: 26px; text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="color: white; font-size: large;">&nbsp; MIT is the method of knowing the past and&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">Healing it. What is meant by healing the past? Our soul is an&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">Electromagnetic Signal surrounded by different level of planes such as&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">physical plane, mental plane, emotional plane, etheric plane, &amp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">Spiritual Plane. Once a person dies the physical plane is gone but the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">soul still has other planes. The unconscious mind of a person remembers&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">everything and all the renowned Psychiatrists agree. These impulses are&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">stored as magnetic records in the mental palne. If a person dies of some</span><br />
<span style="color: white; font-size: large;">mishap the soul will leave the spot immediately with all the planes&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">except physical. But the etheric body as it is EMF and united with the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">physical body might not completely leave the spot. A part of it may not&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">realize that the physical body is dead. And this results in a loss of</span><br />
<span style="color: white; font-size: large;">ether to the Soul. Once the soul takes a new birth the loss of this&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">ether will be stored as magnetic record in the mental plane. This inturn&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">&nbsp;is manifested into the unconscious mind. Hence, the unconscious mind&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">comes to possession of these memories. The loss of ether manifests&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">itself into&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">extreme fear like phobia. Also an unwelcome deed in the past life might&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">result in sufferings at present as&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;">Action and Reaction are Equal and Opposite</span>.</span><br />
<span style="color: white; font-size: large;">This can be known and the present attitude can be corrected because&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">sufferings are just endowed to make a soul humble &amp; perfect. The&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">soul itself creates the circumstances wherein it could repent and&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">compensate for the sin committed by it. This helps it to become more&nbsp;</span><span style="color: white; font-size: large;">virtuous &amp; divine.</span></p>
